# i4mC-Deep:An intelligent predictor of N4-methylcytosine sites using a deep learning approach
This repository contains the source code for i4mC-Deep.

We provided the datasets in Dataset folder as well as 10-fold cross-validation.
Trained models folder contained the best trained model for the all six species. 
The source code folder contained two file. load_model for testing you can direct load the trained model and test data from 10-fold cross-validation. Second file used for training a new model and create a new fold.
